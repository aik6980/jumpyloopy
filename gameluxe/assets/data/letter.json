		"Will I ever see you again? I am unsure where I am,\n but I know I am far from home, far from you. I hope I can see you soon…",
		"The cave is dark, and seemingly endless. Everything seems far away.\n There is no noise, no … anything. I must keep moving, for myself. For you.",
		"A hint of light ahead; a hint of hope. Will you be there, waiting? I hope so.",
		"I escaped but you were not there.\n Disappointing, but I know it means I must keep going.\n Through a verdant forest, I moved and climbed.",
		"I climbed through the trees and up steep mountain sides.\n The grass grew less, the air thinner. Still I searched of you. I did not look back.",
		"Around me was blue, streaked with white. The sky is peaceful.\n The cave is only a memory now. The wind whispers and reminds me of your voice.",
		"Even the sky gives way now, to an endless blanket of ink.\n I search still for you amongst the expanse.\n The starks twinkle; are any of them you?",
		"Planets float like marbles, bright in this dark ocean.\n If only you could see it. Maybe you can. Maybe you will.",
		"The cave is nothing now. Forgotten.\n I think of you, out amongst the stars, and of what is yet to come.",
		"\nEverything burns as brightly as I do for you. I am forever yours.\n All my love."
